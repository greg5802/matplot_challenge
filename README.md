Three trends that I noticed with the data:
1. Urban areas charge more pre trip than comparable rural and suburban areas.
2. Rural areas had the smallest total rides, drivers and fares. This makes sense given certain demographical factors (needs the travel, lifestyle, etc)
3. The number of drivers based on city type varied a little more. One urban city would have five drivers and another would have 20 drivers. Some city size data may have been useful.
